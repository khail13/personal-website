      <h1 style="padding: 20px">Galvanic Fuel Cell Flashlight</h1>

      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        One of today's causes of pollution is the improper disposal of batteries
        containing heavy metals such as lead and mercury. A substitute for
        batteries can simply be water. Thus, the purpose of this project was to
        design, prototype, and test a personal, portable light source for
        off-grid use without containing commercial batteries. To accomplish
        this, the idea was to develop a galvanic cell system. The light would be
        powered by an electrolyte solution such as saltwater, converting the
        stored chemical energy into an electrical potential.
      </p>

      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>
        From rigorous experimentation and testing, it was determined that a
        copper cathode and zinc anode each with an approximate surface area of
        38 cm2, contained within a porous material, and submerged in a saltwater
        solution, would act as an effective battery cell. For the porous
        boundary, a material that could be easily rinsed to remove any residuals
        and was relatively inexpensive was sought. Rockwool is generally used
        for insulating walls and sometimes in hydroponic systems, and it met the
        needs and wants for the cell design. Sizing and orienting the Copper and
        Zinc plates was determined by moving between Cell design and physical
        design. A balance between dimensions of available materials for the PVC
        body and Rockwool combined with a desirable form factor led to the
        finalized cell design composed of 7 copper and 7 zinc alternating
        parallel 3.6 cm by 4.6 cm rectangles inserted into a Rockwool
        rectangular cube with equal spacings of 0.3 cm. The like plates, either
        copper or zinc, were all connected to one another by a conductive and
        shielded wire, effectively creating a single plate of sufficient surface
        area to produce the required power. To increase the power output, three
        cells wired in series were fit into the PVC body.

        The flashlight was designed to minimize form factor, reduce the
        possibility of user error, and maintain operational simplicity. The body
        and cell housing consisted of a 3-inch diameter PVC pipe cut to size.
        The Circuit housing end cap and circuit housing enclosure were both
        designed to be multi-functional components and are proprietary designs.
        The Circuit housing end cap served a permanently sealed end, attached
        with watertight caulking, to the PVC body and cell housing to contain
        the saltwater solution and battery cells. A port allowed for the passage
        and installation of wiring to carry electric current from the cells to
        the primary circuit, once the wiring is passed through the port was
        sealed with watertight caulking as well. The circuit housing end cap
        also acted as the mounting point for the primary circuit PCB, the
        push-button on-off switch, and the goose-neck flexible arm. The square
        form ensured that the assembly does not roll.
      </p>

        To to be able to supply the flashlight LED with enough voltage to allow
        it to light up, it needed to boost the voltage that was released from
        the galvanic cell, as the initial voltage was too weak to do so. To
        accomplish this, the Joule Thief circuit was utilized. The Joule Thief
        Circuit is a voltage booster circuit which converts a constant low
        voltage input into a periodic output of a higher voltage. The peaks in
        the output voltage occur rapidly, causing the LED to flash at a very
        fast rate. However, the LED appears to be constantly lit to the human
        eye due to the persistence effect. The circuit is an arrangement of a
        power source, a resistor, a transistor and a ferrite toroid core wrapped
        with two wires coming from the positive terminal of the power source,
        one through a resistor. A magnetic field is created around the ferrite
        toroid due to the current that passes through the wires. The extra
        current causes the transistor to switch off. As a result, the magnetic
        field is converted into electrical energy which is given as output. Once
        the magnetic field seizes, the transistor is switched back on and
        conducts electricity to create the magnetic field again. This process
        occurs rapidly enough to provide a somewhat constant power output. The
        frequency of voltage spikes that was generated by the assembled circuit
        was over 5KHz.
