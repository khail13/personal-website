      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        Through my experiences with the electric vehicle industry, I have become
        aware of a formidable challenge that engineers, mechanics, and
        technicians face. Electric vehicle battery modules are heavy, large, and
        fragile. Transporting these modules within a workshop or factory is a
        strenuous and daunting task and it often requires the manual labour of
        two or more people to lift and maneuver these devices. This process is
        inefficient and can be dangerous. To combat this challenge, I took upon
        the task of designing a device that could reduce safety risks and
        increase efficiency within workplace settings while transporting EV
        batteries.

      <h2>Design</h2>
      <p>The three primary goals of this design were as follows…</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Enable the movement of battery modules to variable heights with a
          mechanical system to improve workplace efficiency of transporting such
          large and heavy modules.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduce the effort required to accomplish the strenuous task by
          implementing a mechanical lifting system that is capable of being
          powered electrically to minimize the safety risks of heavy lifting.
        </li>
        <li>
          Lessen operation requirements of the lift to require only a singular
          person for the maneuvering and lifting of an EV battery. This will
          reduce labour costs for companies and allow for faster replacement and
          installation of battery modules.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Through a comprehensive and iterative design process consisting of
        multiple phases, numerous analyses and modifications were made. The
        process began with a thorough research phase. The focus of this phase
        was to investigate the real-world metrics and properties of EV
        batteries. This included research into aspects such as average weights
        and maximum sizes of modules and packs alike. The discovery of possible
        methods of raising such modules were found here. The resulting
        conclusion was to design a cost-effective scissor lift cart with ease of
        manufacturability in mind.<br /><br />
        To accomplish this, a mechanism was modeled and analyzed using readily
        available commercial parts and materials including, caster wheels,
        L-beams, sleeve bearings, strut trolleys and channels, hydraulic
        pistons, and clevis pins. The resulting assembly met the initial goals
        and metrics set at the start of the design process and the goal of
        improving workplace efficiency without sacrificing safety had been
        achieved. Attaining the desired minimum and maximum heights (0.5m and
        1.75m respectively) while maintaining an acceptable safety factor in all
        loaded components was crucial to the success of the design. The
        components of the system with the greatest loads, the pins and scissor
        arms, met the desired safety factor of 4, which was verified using FEA
        analyses in SOLIDWORKS. By achieving these metrics, the design is an
        effective and versatile tool to aid in the transportation of EV
        batteries. <br /><br />

        "
      />
      <p>
        The design can be improved to make the manufacturing process of the
        product more feasible. The large safety factors contribute immensely to
        the cost as they can lead to “over-designing” and hence more material
        required than necessary. The decision to implement large safety factors
        in the preliminary calculations were to combat many simplifications and
        assumptions (i.e. disregarding the z-direction in the static
        calculations and thus neglecting torsion) which left many uncertainties
        when transitioning from statics to dynamics. More detailed calculations
        would allow for reduction in the required safety factor in the range of
        2 to 2.5 which would reduce the required pin diameters and section
        moduli for the scissor members and thus decrease the weight and cost of
        the system. Additional features can also be added in the future to
        extend the product's effectiveness such as a tipping-bed which would aid
        the loading process.
